// Package kv defines a general interface for a key-value store that provides support for get/set/delete operations
// as well as basic read-iteration. This package should be used as a boundary for separating an application from a
// specific storage implementation.

// For a general implementation of DB, see the pebblekv package.
// For an in-memory implementation of DB, see the memkv package.
