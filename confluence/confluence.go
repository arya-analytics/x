// Package confluence implements a generic, template based component framework for
// building concurrent value passing programs. Confluence is built around two core
// types: Value and Segment.
//
// A Value can is any piece of data that can be passed through
// a go channel. Because channels are typically mutex locked, values should generally
// be exchanged as batches of data as opposed to individual entities (i.e.
// pass []int as the as opposed to int).
//
// A Segment is an entity that processes values. A Segment is typically
// a goroutine that reads values from an input channel, does some operation on them
// (sum, avg, IO write, network write, etc.), and passes a result to an output channel.
// This is not to say that the functionality of a Segment cannot extend beyond a
// simple transformation.
//
// For example, a Segment can route values from a set of inputs (called Outlet(s)) to
// a set of outputs (called Inlet(s)). The input-Outlet, outlet-Inlet naming convention
// might seem strange at first, but the general idea is that an Outlet is the end of a
// stream that emits values (i.e. <-chan Value) and an Inlet is a stream that receives
// values (i.e. chan<- Value). Inlets and Outlets are also addressable, which allows you
// to send messages to segments with different addresses based on some criteria.
//
// Collections of Segments can also be composed into a pipeline using the plumber
// package's plumber.Pipeline. The Pipeline type is itself a Segment that can be
// connected to other Segment(s). This allows for a flexible and powerful
// composition capabilities.
//
// The confluence package provides a number of built-in Segments that can be used
// by themselves or embedded into custom Segment(s) that provide functionality specific
// to your use case.
//
// A Segment is a composition of three interfaces:
//
// 		1. Flow - Flow.Flow method is used to start any and all operations (goroutines,
//		network pipes, etc.) used by a Segment. The context provided to Flow should be
//		used to stop operations and clear process resources.
//
//		2. Source - A Source is the part of the Segment that can send values to output
//		streams (Inlet(s)). Inlets(s) are bound to the Sink (and therefore Segment)
//		by calling the ApplySink.OutTo(inlets ...Inlet[ValueType]) method.
//
//		3. Sink - A Sink is the part of the Segment that can receive values.
//		Input streams (Outlet(s)). Outlet(s) are bound to the Sink (and therefore Segment)
//		by calling the Sink.InFrom(outlets ...Outlet[ValueType]) method.
//
// All of this flexibility comes at the cost of needing to follow a few important rules
// and principles when writing programs based on confluence:
//
// 		1. All input streams (Outlet(s)) must be bound to a Segment by using
//		the InFrom() method.
//
//		2. All output streams (Inlet(s)) must be bound to a Segment by using
//		the OutTo() method.
//
//		3. The only way to start a Segment is by calling the Flow.Flow method. A single
//		instance of a Segment (if passed as a pointer) should generally only be running
//		once at a time. This is not to say that Segment(s) shouldn't be restarted. This
//		rule is more of a guideline, and can be broken when you know what you're doing.
//		If you're worried about this happening, check out the Gate, GateSource,
//		and GateSink functions; these implement locks that prevent the segment from
//		being started while already running).
//
// Related packages:
//
//		1. transfluence - implements transport for writing Segment(s) that
//		interact with a network transport.
//
//		2. plumber - components for connecting Segment(s) together and routing
//		streams between them.
